# OpenSSL Configuration File for Creating a Root Certificate Authority (CA)

This configuration file is used to create and manage a Root Certificate Authority (CA) with OpenSSL. The CA is responsible for signing and issuing certificates that establish secure connections and validate the identity of servers, clients, or other entities.

## How It Works

1. **Root CA Creation**: The Root CA is created by generating a private key and a self-signed certificate. This certificate serves as the trusted root for all certificates issued by this CA.
2. **Configuration File Purpose**: A configuration file like this one ensures consistent settings for key generation, certificate signing requests (CSRs), and certificate issuance.
3. **Policies and Extensions**: Policies and extensions defined here enforce strict validation of certificate requests and provide additional information like key usage and constraints.
4. **Trust Inheritance**: Certificates issued by the CA inherit trust from the root certificate. Any entity with the root certificate installed can validate the authenticity of certificates issued by the CA.
5. **CA Infrastructure Management**: The CA infrastructure includes tracking issued certificates, revocation lists, and managing private keys securely.

## About `ca.cnf`

The configuration file for the Root CA is typically named `ca.cnf`. It contains all the settings needed to manage the CA, including directory structure, policies, and extensions. This file ensures that the process of creating and issuing certificates is consistent and repeatable. The examples and instructions below assume the use of a `ca.cnf` file.

## Configuration Sections

### `[ ca ]`
Specifies the default CA settings. The `default_ca` parameter points to the configuration block that contains the detailed CA settings. This allows multiple CA profiles to be defined in one file.

```ini
[ ca ]
default_ca = CA_default
```

### `[ CA_default ]`
Directory and file locations for the CA infrastructure.

```ini
[ CA_default ]
dir             = .                    # Base directory for the CA.
certs           = $dir/certs           # Directory for storing issued certificates.
crl_dir         = $dir/crl             # Directory for storing certificate revocation lists.
new_certs_dir   = $dir/newcerts        # Directory for newly issued certificates.
database        = $dir/index.txt       # Database file for tracking issued certificates.
serial          = $dir/serial          # File to maintain the next serial number for certificate issuance.
RANDFILE        = $dir/.rand           # Random seed file.
private_key     = $dir/ca.key          # Private key file for the CA.
certificate     = $dir/ca.crt          # Root certificate file for the CA.

default_md      = sha256               # Default message digest algorithm.
policy          = policy_strict        # Specifies the policy to use when issuing certificates.
```

### `[ policy_strict ]`
Rules for verifying the distinguished name fields in certificate requests.

```ini
[ policy_strict ]
countryName             = optional        # Must match the CA's country name.
stateOrProvinceName     = optional        # Must match the CA's state or province name.
organizationName        = optional        # Must match the CA's organization name.
organizationalUnitName  = optional        # Organizational unit is not required.
commonName              = supplied        # Common name must be provided.
emailAddress            = optional        # Email addresses are optional.
```

### `[ req ]`
Configuration for certificate signing requests (CSRs).

```ini
[ req ]
default_bits        = 2048             # Key size in bits.
default_md          = sha256           # Message digest for signing.
prompt              = no               # Disable interactive prompts.
default_keyfile     = ca.key           # Default private key file.
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name
```

### `[ req_distinguished_name ]`
Distinguished name fields for the CSR.

```ini
[ req_distinguished_name ]
C   = SE                              # Country name.
ST  = Stockholm                       # State or province name.
O   = STI                             # Organization name.
CN  = root.johan.se                   # Common name.
```

### `[ v3_ca ]`
Extensions for the CA certificate.

```ini
[ v3_ca ]
subjectKeyIdentifier   = hash         # Identifies the subject's public key.
authorityKeyIdentifier = keyid:always,issuer # Identifies the CA.
basicConstraints       = critical,CA:true # Specifies this as a CA certificate.
keyUsage               = critical,keyCertSign,cRLSign # Key usages allowed.
```

## Commands to Create the Root CA

1. **Generate the private key**:
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out ca.key 2048
   ```

2. **Create the CSR**:
   ```bash
   openssl req -config ca.cnf -new -key ca.key -out ca.csr
   ```

3. **Create the root certificate**:
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -days 365 -signkey ca.key -in ca.csr -out ca.crt -extfile ca.cnf -extensions v3_ca
   ```

## Instructions for Clients and Servers

1. **Create configuration files for client and server CSRs**:
   - For example, `client.cnf` and `server.cnf`.

2. **Generate private keys for client and server**:
   ```bash
   openssl genrsa -out client.key 2048
   openssl genrsa -out server.key 2048
   ```

3. **Create the CSRs**:
   ```bash
   openssl req -new -key client.key -out client.csr -config client.cnf
   openssl req -new -key server.key -out server.csr -config server.cnf
   ```

4. **Sign the CSRs with the CA's certificate and private key**:
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -in client.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
    -out client.crt -days 365 -sha256 -extfile client.cnf -extensions v3_req
   ```
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
    -out server.crt -days 365 -sha256 -extfile server.cnf -extensions v3_req
   ```
   ```bash
   openssl x509 -req -in broker.csr -CA ca.crt -CAkey ca.key -CAcreateserial \
    -out broker.crt -days 365 -sha256 -extfile broker.cnf -extensions v3_req
   ```

5. **Distribute the signed certificates**:
   - Provide `client.crt` and `server.crt` to the respective entities.

## Example `client.cnf`

Below is an example configuration file for creating a client CSR:

```ini
[ req ]
default_bits        = 2048             # Key size in bits.
default_md          = sha256           # Message digest for signing.
prompt              = no               # Disable interactive prompts.
distinguished_name  = req_distinguished_name

[ req_distinguished_name ]
C   = SE                              # Country name.
ST  = Stockholm                       # State or province name.
O   = STI                             # Organization name.
OU  = Client Division                 # Organizational unit name.
CN  = client.johan.se                 # Common name (e.g., client domain or identifier).
```
